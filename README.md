# GRIT - Graph-based Rating Inference over Time
# GRIT  
## Graph-aware Rating Inference over Time  
### Next Contest Rating Prediction

---

## 📌 Overview

The **GRIT challenge** evaluates models on the task of predicting the **next contest rating** of competitive programmers.

Each contest is represented as a graph snapshot where:
- Nodes correspond to a subset of participating contestants.
- Edges connect contestants with similar ratings at the time of contest registration.

The task is to predict the `nextRating` of each contestant in an **autoregressive evaluation setting**, where past predictions are used to construct future inputs.

---

# 📂 Data
## Data Description
The dataset is based on **5000 contestants from Kaggle**. Multiple preprocessing steps were applied to tailor it to the graph structure and the GRIT challenge.

Each snapshot corresponds to a single contest:
- Nodes represent a subset of participating contestants.
- Edges connect nodes based on their relative ratings when entering the contest.

---

## 🧩 Node Features

Each node contains the following information:
- **node_id** – a unique identifier for each node in the dataset
- **handle** – serves as the contestant ID (strings were converted into integers for privacy)
- **oldRating** – contestant’s rating when registering for contest *i*  
- **rating** – contestant’s rating after contest *i*  
- **num_problems_solved** – number of problems solved in contest *i*  
- **nextRating** – contestant’s rating in the next contest they participate in (*i+1*) → **target to be predicted**  
- **participation_gap** – number of contests since the contestant’s last participation  
- **contestant_count** – total number of contestants in contest *i*

---

## 🔗 Edge Construction

Edges are constructed according to the following criteria:
Two nodes *(u, v)* are connected if:
|oldRating_u - oldRating_v| < Δ

- The value of **Δ (delta)** was selected such that the number of edges in any snapshot is less than 30,000.
- If a node does not satisfy the above condition with any other node, it is connected to up to **three nodes** with the smallest rating difference (when possible), to avoid isolated nodes.

---

# 🏗 Training Data Structure

Each contest snapshot is represented by:
- An adjacency matrix  
- A feature matrix  

Inside the `training/` folder:

### `nodes.parquet`

Used to construct the **feature matrix** for each contest snapshot.

Format:
node_id, handle, contestId,	oldRating, rating,	problems_solved_num, contestants_count, nextRating

### `edges.parquet`

Used to construct the **adjacency matrix** for each contest snapshot.

Format:
contest_id, src, dst

# 🧪 Testing & Evaluation

Model evaluation is performed in an **autoregressive manner**.

---

## First Appearance in Test Set

For contestants appearing for the first time in the testing data:

- All features except `nextRating` are available.

---

## Subsequent Appearances

When a contestant appears again in the testing data, the following features will be set to **-1** (invalid rating):

- `oldRating`
- `rating`

These values must be filled using your model’s previous predictions:

- `rating` at contest *(i−1)* → becomes `oldRating` at contest *(i)*  
- `nextRating` at contest *(i−1)* → becomes `rating` at contest *(i)*  

---

### 💡 Implementation Hint

You may maintain two dictionaries:

- `old_rate[handle]`
- `current_rate[handle]`

Where:

- `old_rate` stores rating at *(i−1)*
- `current_rate` stores predicted `nextRating` at *(i−1)*

At each contest snapshot in the test set:

- Update these values for participating contestants.
- Use them to fill missing features before making predictions.

# 📊 Evaluation Metric

## Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
MAE = (1/N) * Σ |y_true − y_pred|

---

# ⚠️ Why is GRIT Challenging?

## 1️⃣ Missing Values

In a few samples, the raw dataset included rating changes but did not include the number of solved problems.

This results in rare cases where:
rating > oldRating
num_problems_solved = 0

Models must be resilient to these noisy samples.

---

## 2️⃣ Inconsistent Participation

Some contestants participate irregularly.

The model must account for the `participation_gap` when predicting the next rating.

---

## 3️⃣ Registration Rules

Contestants register for contests before they start.

As long as a contestant registers, they are considered a participant, and the contest affects their rating.

If a contestant registers but does not solve any problems, their rating may drop as if they participated and solved none.

---

## 4️⃣ Error Accumulation

Because evaluation is autoregressive:

- Prediction errors propagate forward.
- Mistakes in early contests affect later predictions.
- Models must remain stable over long horizons.

---

# 🎯 Goal

Develop a model that:

- Leverages graph structure within contests  
- Handles irregular participation  
- Remains stable under autoregressive rollout  
- Minimizes MAE on the test set
